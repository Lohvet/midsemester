                What is a blockchain?
                A blockchain is a database that is used to store and organise data. Traditional databases organise data into tables, which are made up of rows and columns. This makes it simple for computers to recognise the data. However, with blockchains, data is digitally formatted and organised into clusters or blocks. Each block has a finite amount of storage.

                When that capacity is achieved, the block shuts and uses cryptography to link to the previous block, forming a chain. When one block joins another, cryptography provides an unchangeable timestamp. This permanent record ensures that sensitive data, such as transactions, remains accurate. Traditional databases, on the other hand, are usually managed by a single entity. An organization or administrator may manage and keep sensitive data.

                Blockchain is popularly recognized as the backbone of cryptocurrency and is even mistaken for cryptocurrency on occasion but there is much more to it than that.

            <p>
                Building, maintaining, and designing blockchain applications and systems are referred to as blockchain development. Overall, it aims to solve issues and generate opportunities by utilising the unique qualities of blockchain technology.

                The smart contract is an example of cutting-edge blockchain development. Smart contracts, like ordinary contracts, are written agreements between two parties. Smart contracts, like regular contracts, are computer programmes that are stored on a blockchain. These programmes are only activated when both parties agree to the terms and conditions. This automated compliance ensures that a contract is correctly executed in real-time.

                When it comes to smart contracts, comparing them to parking meters is an excellent approach to visualize their utility. You make the proper payment and receive the parking validation that corresponds to it. Because the agreement is established, no third-party intervention, such as a cashier, is required.

                Who is a Blockchain Developer?
                Blockchain developers are working on a blockchain network or a decentralised application for it. That isn’t to say that all blockchain developers are pros. However, they won’t be able to call themselves blockchain developers for long if they aren’t.

                A certified blockchain developer is familiar with the blockchain architecture, underlying technology, and the steps required to integrate the many blockchain components into a single system. The developer understands how encryption and data structures integrate into the blockchain system, as well as how to implement effective consensus protocols and create decentralised apps and smart contracts.

                A blockchain developer is also familiar with the programming languages that are used to create the blockchain components. Although not every blockchain developer has the same level of expertise in every area, they all have a broad understanding of what it takes to build a successful blockchain network and its applications.

                There are two types of blockchain developers, namely:

                Core Blockchain Developers
                Blockchain Software Developers
